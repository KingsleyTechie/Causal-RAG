# Causal-RAG
Causal-RAG: A framework for causally-augmented retrieval to reduce hallucinations in clinical AI systems. Enhances RAG with causal inference for safer medical decision support in low-resource settings.

Causal-RAG is a research framework that enhances standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by incorporating causal inference principles to reduce hallucinations and improve trust in clinical decision support. The framework prioritizes causally-sound evidence over mere correlations, making AI systems safer for low-resource healthcare settings where expert validation may be limited.

Key features:
• Causally-augmented retrieval mechanism
• Evidence quality scoring
• Safety-focused confidence calibration
• Modular architecture for clinical applications
• Comprehensive evaluation metrics (accuracy + safety)

This work demonstrates the critical trade-off between accuracy and safety in clinical AI, providing a foundation for more trustworthy medical AI systems.
